`Detectron2 is the object detection and segmentation platform released by Facebook AI Research (FAIR) as an open-source project.It is a second generation of the library as the first Detectron was written in Caffe2 and then with the maskrcnn-benchmark reimplemented in PyTorch 1.0. Detectron2 is a ground-up rewrite and extension of the previous effort using PyTorch.`

- Detectron2 beyond state-of-the-art object detection algorithms includes numerous models like *instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, pose estimation, DensePose, TridentNet,Cascade R-CNN, rotated bounding boxes, etc..*

- You can look at the Detectron2 [Model Zoo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/master/MODEL_ZOO.md) site to find a broad set of baseline results and trained models to start with.Regards to FAIR’s team, Facebook AI’s computer vision engineers created **Detectron2go**, which is an additional layer that will allow easy and optimized model deployment to production (but not yet released).
